				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Putting the age data on the map, we can see the age distribution of men and women in New South Wales, which eventually leads to problems between regions. By comparing data from men and women of all ages, I found their differences. Our data are from the Australian Bureau of statistics, working with other sources and working in QGIS.</p>

										         <p>We can observe that in 2011, generally between 0-19 and 40-59 years old, the number of male and female is large, the number of people over 80 years old is always the smallest. The largest number of people live in the center of the city, perhaps because the city center is so prosperous that more people choose to live here. In the south-central and west-oriented areas, no one has ever lived, probably because the area is not developed or suburban, so no one chooses to live here. As age increases, most people migrate eastward to the north.</p>

In the south-central region, where there were no inhabitants, the number of people in this area increased dramatically in 2016, probably because the area was developed, so many people chose to move here. There are still a lot of people in the middle, but not as many as in 2011, and maybe other places are becoming comfortable, so people choose to go somewhere else. With the increase of age, more and more people emigrate to the East.</p>

											 <p>In 2016, there were more people of all ages than in 2011, but the gap between them was not very large. And the growth rate varies from age group to age group. Between the first age group and the second age group, the growth rate in 2011 was initially higher than in 2016, but then reversed by 2016. Between the second and third age groups, growth in 2016 was initially higher than in 2011, but then reversed by 2011. Between the third and fifth age groups, the growth rate in 2016 was consistently higher than in 2011. The largest difference is at the age of fourth. Whether in 2016 or 2011, the number of people aged 20-39 is always the most.</p>

												<h3>Different between male and female</h3>
												<p>To study the differences between the number of male and female in different age groups and regions, I made the following map. The red part indicates that there are more female than male in the area, and the orange part indicates that there are more male than female in the area.</p>

								 <p>As can be seen from the maps, the number of males aged 0-40 is significantly lower than that of females, but the gap is not very large. There are obvious differences except for some areas in the central and west to south directions. Overall, we can see that women between the ages of 0 and 40 are concentrated in the north, while men between the ages of 0 and 40 are concentrated in the southeast. This may be related to the climate and urban structure of each region, which will lead to differences in the number of men and women.</p>

								<p>As can be seen from the maps, the number of men over 40 is significantly higher than that of women. In 2011, almost every part of the population had more men than women. In 2016, although most regions have more males than females, the proportion of males than females are not as large as in 2011. We can see that men over 40 are all over New South Wales and women are concentrated in the southeast. By contrast, in 2011, we could infer that most women moved to the southeast.</p>

					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>First, the sustained growth of the total population from 2011 to 2016 indicates that the birth rate in New South Wales was higher than the death rate during these five years. On the second hand, from the direction of people's migration, the construction of the suburbs is getting better and better, and the population is more balanced in all places. Third, the maps of gender differences tell us that in 2016, there will be more men than women, but statistics show that there are fewer men than women, so we can conclude that women are clustered in the eastern part of the country. Indicating that the eastern direction is more suitable for women to live in.</p>
